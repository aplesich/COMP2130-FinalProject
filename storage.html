    <h1>localStorage</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Definition </h2>
    <p>localStorage is a method we may use to store data locally within the user's browser with no expiration date. localStroage will hold the data, with no expiry date, as a result the data will not be deleted even if the browser is closed and opened again.
    <br>
    localStorage can be accessed rather quickly compared to back end storage methods, that is why it is an ideal way for a user to store a small amount of relevant data they want to access later. 
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It stores up to 5-10MB of data , the amount of storage allowed is dependant on the browser</li>
      <li>Easy to use – no need for a web server or backend database.</li>
      <li>Great for getting an idea up and running and for testing purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Can only be text, data will always be a “read-only” format</li>
      <li>Anything stored with localstorage is not secure, because it can be accessed relatively quickly with code. As a result, we should never store private or personal information through localStorage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <h3>Add data</h3>
    <p>To add the data in localStorage, both key and value are required to pass in setItem() function.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>localStorage.setItem("girl", "Helen");  </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Retrieve data</h3>
    <p>A key is required to retrieve the data from storage and a JavaScript variable to store the returned data.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>var storedData = localStorage.getItem("girl");</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Remove data</h3>
    <p>The same key is required to remove the value attached with it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>localStorage.removeItem("girl");  </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Clear localStorage</h3>
    <p>Using a simple clear() function, it will remove all the localStorage data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>localStorage.clear()  </li>
    </ul>
