  <p>storage.html is an HTML page that uses your own words and or images to explain how window.localStorage works. You will be teaching me (your instructor) how it works. There are lots of tutorials out there, but you must use your own words and your own demonstrations. The clearer your tutorial is, and the better your demonstration is, the higher your mark will be. So, give a short write up with explanations and examples of localStorage, plus a demo on this page.</p>
